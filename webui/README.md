# Running the project
1. download the [.env.loacl](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tMhelmNGbZCidJW28xRcs4SI0pQ8AOyF) file, place it in the main directory (where `package.json`). If you can't access this file, just mail me: `omrilevy@mail.tau.ac.il`
2. run: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` (will be fixed soon)
3. run `npm start`
4. Notice that in order to use the app you'll have to sign up and sign in (firebase authentication).
You can also use our mock user: `test1@test.com/123456`.
