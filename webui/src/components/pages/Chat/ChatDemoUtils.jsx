  0:"The \
  main cause of the rift between Biden and Netanyahu is Netanyahu's new government\'s controversial\
  push to gain greater control over the country's Supreme Court. Biden had no immediate plans to offer\
  the traditional visit of a new Israeli prime minister to the Oval Office, which was seen as a rebuke to\
  Netanyahu, McCarthy's recent visit to Israel and his\
  willingness to invite Netanyahu to Washington may have further complicated the already tense relationship between the two leaders.",

  1:"Biden opposes the\
  Republicans\' demands for spending cuts, the repeal of federal funds to fight climate\
  change and pursue tax cheats, a set of new work requirements on welfare recipients, and an end to Biden\â€™s\
  plan to cancel student debts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. He characterizes these demands as \"reckless\
  hostage taking\" and has called for lawmakers to raise the debt ceiling without conditions. Biden has also warned of \
  the severe consequences of failing to raise the debt ceiling, including harm to American families, global leadership \
  position, and national security interests, and a negative impact on the credit rating of the United States."
